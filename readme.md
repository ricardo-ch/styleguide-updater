# How to use

This is the script you need to update from Styleguide version 44 to version 45.
See https://github.com/ricardo-ch/style-guide-react/releases/tag/v45.0.0

The first argument is the folder where you wanna do the changes (I think mostly you need to do that in `src` folder).

Example:

```
npx https://github.com/ricardo-ch/styleguide-updater src
```

That's it
